1. In an Angular app displaying a large dataset, how would you implement virtual scrolling and optimize change detection to improve performance? Explain your approach to ensure smooth rendering and scalability.
It is crucial for enhancing performance and ensuring a smooth user experience. Virtual scrolling is a technique that draws only the visible portion of a large dataset, rather than rendering all items at once. This can reduce the number of DOM elements in the view, leading to improved performance. I… more
2. In Angular, you need to filter a list of items without triggering a full re-render of the page, ensuring optimal performance and a smooth user experience. How would you implement this? What challenges could arise, and how would you address them?
I can follow the following approach to implement. - Use a Pipe for Filtering: Create a custom pipe that filters the list based on the user's input. Pipes in Angular are pure by default, meaning they only re-evaluate when their input changes, which helps in optimizing performance - Use the… more
3. You're developing a new feature in Angular and the product owner requests changes that will affect the timeline. How do you manage this situation, ensuring both technical needs and business goals are met while collaborating effectively with the team?
- Communicate with the Product Owner
- Collaborate with the Team
- Negotiate and Find Compromises
- Document Everything
- Maintain Open Communication
4. Are you able to take a test task? It should not take more than 1 day to complete.
Certainly! I would be happy to take on a test task. Please provide the details of the task, including any specific requirements or guidelines, and I'll ensure to complete it within the given timeframe.
5. How many hours per week are you available?
I can work over 40 hours per week.

# Possible questions:

## Can you introduce yourself?
 Sure, I am Vladyslav. My full name is vladyslav Karpeniuk Sergiovuch. I live in Zhytomyrska. I am 31 years old. My nationality is Ukraine. I was born in Kyiv. I am a web developer, freelancer, especially expert in Angular and Typescript. As a web developer, I have worked for 5 years old. My stacks are Angular, Next.js, SCSS, and TailwindCSS. I like reading and tennis. I dislike drinking and smoking. 

## What frameworks have you worked on?
I have worked on React.js, Next.js, and Angular. In addition, I have worked on Django and .net.

## What is Angular?
Angular is a popular open-source front-end web application framework maintained by Google, used for building single-page applications (SPAs). It's built with TypeScript and provides developers with tools and libraries to create rich, dynamic web applications. Angular offers a component-based architecture, where everything is structured around components, making code modular and reusable.
Key features include:
- Two-way data binding: Automatically synchronizes data between the model and view components.
- Dependency injection: Helps manage the components and services that your application depends on.
- Routing: Allows seamless navigation within the application.
- Reactive forms and template-driven forms: Handle form inputs and validations efficiently.
- Directives and Pipes: Extend HTML functionality and format data.

## How many experiences do you have on Angular and TypeScript?
I have several years of experience working with Angular and TypeScript. Over the course of my projects, I’ve built and maintained numerous single-page applications (SPAs), utilizing Angular's component-based architecture and powerful tooling like RxJS for handling asynchronous data streams. My expertise also includes state management with NgRx and form handling using both reactive and template-driven forms in Angular.

With TypeScript, I've consistently benefited from its static typing, which helps in detecting errors early and writing more maintainable, scalable code. This has been crucial in building large-scale applications where strong typing ensures that the codebase remains robust as it grows. My use of TypeScript extends to interfaces, generics, and advanced types, which further enhances the development process in Angular projects.

I have successfully implemented various features such as lazy loading for optimizing app performance, routing and navigation for complex apps, and integrated RESTful APIs using HttpClient. These experiences have strengthened my knowledge of both Angular and TypeScript, making me proficient in building high-quality, scalable applications.
## What are your recent experiences in Angular?

In my recent experiences with Angular, I've worked on several large-scale applications that leveraged Angular's robust architecture for building dynamic and efficient user interfaces. One project involved creating a custom dashboard for an e-commerce platform, where I implemented lazy loading for optimal performance and used Angular Material to create a responsive and interactive UI.
Another recent project was focused on data-heavy applications, where I utilized RxJS for handling asynchronous data streams and state management with NgRx. This allowed me to efficiently manage and synchronize the state across different components.
Additionally, I have integrated RESTful APIs with Angular's HttpClient module, making use of interceptors for handling authentication tokens and error handling globally.

## What is your hourly rate?
My standard hourly rate is $25, but I'm open to discussing project-based pricing depending on the scope of work. So I can work on $20/hour.

## What communication platforms are you familiar with?
I’m familiar with a range of communication platforms, including Slack, Telegram, and Skype for team collaboration. But I don't know to talk this word by upwork policy.

## Do you have github account and if so can you send me your email address? it needs to send you invitation.
Sure, I have several accounts, but I will send now my account icandev0220@gmail. You can send this account an invitation.
