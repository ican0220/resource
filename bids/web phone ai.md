Hello, as a senior web/ai developer, I can complete your project with my hourly rate $60. I have extensive experiences and skills in similar projects. I can deliver the result with high quality within deadlines. I am passionate on website developments and stay cutting to edges.


I have already developed similar projects:
Title: A call tracking and analytics platform that provides call recording, lead tracking, and integration with various CRM systems
Website: https://www.callrail.com/
Tech Stack: OpenAi, python, Angular.
I worked as full stack developer, and created responsive and user-friendly design and wrote well structured, maintainable code.

Creating an AI-powered agent dialer for outbound sales calls is a comprehensive project that involves several components. I follow the following steps:
Step 1: Define Your Requirements
1. Features: Clearly outline the features you want to include:
   - Call efficiency optimization
   - Lead filtering
   - Follow-up scheduling
   - Integration with your CRM
   - Call recording and transcription
   - SMS/email automation based on call outcomes

2. User Stories: Create user stories to understand how your sales agents will interact with the system.

Step 2: Choose Your Tech Stack
1. Telephony System: Decide between using an existing telephony system like ViciDial or Twilio. Twilio is often easier to integrate with and has a robust API.
2. Programming Language: Choose a programming language for your backend. Python and Node.js are both suitable choices.
3. Database: Select a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store leads, call logs, and outcomes.

Step 3: Set Up the Telephony System
1. Twilio Setup:
   - Create a Twilio account and set up a phone number for outbound calls.
   - Use Twilio’s API to initiate calls, manage call flows, and handle responses.

2. ViciDial Setup (if chosen):
   - Install and configure ViciDial on your server.
   - Familiarize yourself with its API for integration.

Step 4: Implement AI Features
1. Lead Filtering:
   - Use machine learning models to analyze lead data and determine potential leads.
   - Train models on historical call data to optimize lead scoring.

2. Follow-Up Scheduling:
   - Implement a scheduling system that allows agents to set follow-up reminders based on call outcomes.

3. Call Recording and Transcription:
   - Use Twilio’s call recording feature or integrate with a service like Deepgram for transcription.
   - Ensure compliance with legal requirements for call recording.

Step 5: Integrate with CRM
1. CRM API: Identify the CRM you are using and explore its API documentation for integration.
2. Data Sync: Develop a module to sync leads, call outcomes, and follow-up tasks between  dialer and CRM.

Step 6: Implement Automation
1. SMS/Email Automation: Use Twilio for SMS and an email service (like SendGrid) for email automation.
2. Trigger Automation: Set up triggers based on call outcomes to send follow-up messages or emails.

Step 7: Build the User Interface
1. UI Framework: Choose a frontend framework (React, Vue.js, or Angular) to build the user interface for agents.
2. Dashboard: Create a dashboard that displays call metrics, lead information, and follow-up tasks.

My skills include:
-Frontend
   - Framework: React or Vue.js
   - UI Component Library: 
     - Material-UI*(for React) or Vuetify (for Vue.js)
   - State Management: 
     - Redux (for React) or Vuex (for Vue.js) for managing application state.
-  backend
   - Programming Language: 
     - Node.js or *ython
   - Framework: 
     - Express.js (for Node.js) or Flask/Django (for Python)
- Telephony
   - Twilio: 
   - ViciDial: 
- AI and Machine Learning
   - Machine Learning Framework: 
     - Scikit-learn or TensorFlow (for Python) to build models for lead scoring and filtering.
   - Natural Language Processing: 
     - spaCy or NLTK for processing call transcriptions and analyzing call outcomes.
- Database
   - SQL Database: 
     - PostgreSQL or MySQL
   - NoSQL Database: 
     - MongoDB 
- CRM Integration**
     - Use the REST API of your chosen CRM (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot) to sync leads, call outcomes, and follow-up tasks.
- Call Recording and Transcription**
   - Deepgram
   - Twilio

I have good understanding about all processes of backend development, and I follow the most effective methodology for delivering the result. I am hard worker and passionate of web development. If you give this task, I will devote myself to complete this task successfully. I hope to work with you.
Thank you.
