Hello, I am Brenton. Yes, I can develop Google Ads conversion tracking on your Softr-hosted website. Below are the steps to set up conversion tracking, including how to add the necessary tracking and Captcha codes. Since Softr is a no-code platform, some steps may require specific configurations, but I can achieve the desired functionality with the right approach.

Step 1: Set Up Conversion Actions in Google Ads

1. Log in to Google Ads
   - Go to your Google Ads account.

2. Create a Conversion Action
   - Click on the "Tools & Settings" icon (wrench) in the upper right corner.
   - Under "Measurement," select "Conversions."
   - Click on the "+" button to add a new conversion action.
   - Choose the type of conversion you want to track (e.g., "Website").
   - Fill in the required details, such as the conversion name, value, count, conversion window, and category (e.g., "Lead" for form submissions).

3. Set Up the Conversion Tag
   - After creating the conversion action, Google Ads will provide you with a conversion tracking tag (code snippet).
   - You will need to copy this code snippet for later use.

Step 2: Add the Conversion Tracking Code to the Thank You Page

1. Identify the Thank You Page
   - Determine the URL of the "thank you" page that users are redirected to after form submission.

2. Add the Tracking Code
   - In Softr, go to your project and navigate to the settings for the page where you want to add the tracking code.
   - Look for an option to add custom code or scripts (usually found in the page settings or in a specific section for custom scripts).
   - Paste the Google Ads conversion tracking code snippet into the appropriate section for the "thank you" page.

Step 3: Implement Google Tag Manager (Optional)

If you prefer to use Google Tag Manager (GTM) instead of directly embedding code, follow these steps:

1. Set Up Google Tag Manager
   - Create a Google Tag Manager account if you don’t have one.
   - Set up a new container for your Softr site and get the GTM code snippet.

2. Add GTM Code to Softr
   - In Softr, navigate to the settings where you can add custom scripts and paste the GTM code snippet in the header and body sections as instructed by GTM.

3. Create a New Tag for Google Ads Conversion
   - In GTM, create a new tag and select "Google Ads Conversion Tracking" as the tag type.
   - Enter your conversion ID and label, which you got from the Google Ads conversion setup.
   - Set a trigger for this tag to fire on the "thank you" page.

Step 4: Add Captcha to Your Softr Site

1. Choose a Captcha Service
   - Decide whether you want to use Google reCAPTCHA or another Captcha service.

2. Get Captcha Keys
   - For Google reCAPTCHA, go to the [reCAPTCHA website](https://www.google.com/recaptcha) and register your site to get the site key and secret key.

3. Integrate Captcha into Softr
   - In Softr, go to the form settings where you want to add the Captcha.
   - Look for an option to enable Captcha or add custom code.
   - If there’s an option to add custom HTML, you can embed the reCAPTCHA widget using the site key you obtained.

I can start the work immediately. I can deliver the best result within deadlines. I hope to work with you for long time.
Thank you.
