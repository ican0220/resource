In a remote environment, I prioritize clear and consistent communication with stakeholders. I usually begin by setting expectations for updates and agreeing on communication channels. I provide regular progress reports, either daily reports or at key project milestones. I am good at project management tools like Jira.

For unit testing, I typically use Jest because of its seamless integration with Vue components and its extensive mocking capabilities, which are essential for isolated component tests. Additionally, I set up CI/CD pipelines with tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to automatically run tests on each pull request, which helps catch issues early and maintain high code standards.
