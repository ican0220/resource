Hello, I can work on your Konva.js project with my hourly rate $15. I have extensive experiences and skills in konva chart. I have recently developed a konva project. I uploaded my previous work results. You can check my experiences and skills from it.
I worked on Next.js with typescript and konva.js node module. Building a drawing tool using Next.js and Konva is a great project! Konva is a powerful 2D canvas library that can help you create interactive drawings. 

My skills include:
- html, css, js, ts
- node.js, next.js and react.js, vue.js
- konva chart.
- git, github and gitlab

I can start the work right now. I can work on full time. I can devote myself to deliver the best result as quickly as possible. I hope to work with you.
Thank you.
