Hello
Good day! I see you are looking a reliable developer to implement automation of pulling down a CSV export and then pushing that data to Mantle - https://heymantle.com/docs/api

I understand that this project automates the daily export of Shopify theme purchase data by logging into the Shopify Partner Dashboard, triggering the export, and retrieving the CSV file from email. Using Puppeteer and a scheduled script, the CSV is unzipped and its data is automatically uploaded to Mantle via API without manual intervention. This ensures consistent, efficient data synchronization between Shopify and Mantle, eliminating the need for manual export and import processes.

I shared details of approach to implement: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ycg0SpOk7tD5ptnSSOEQ4FGYCWdg6Gaz/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=100013399175821681216&rtpof=true&sd=true

My skills include:
- Node.js 
- Puppeteer
- Node-imap 
- Mailparser 
- Node-fetch or Axios 
- cron or node-cron 

I think you had good job of explaining about your job, but I have some questions.
1. If multiple accounts access this dashboard, should we automate the export process for each account, or only specific ones?
2. Is the file format consistent (CSV in a ZIP)? Should we prepare for potential changes in attachment types or names?

I am ready to discuss more details about your project at anytime. 
Thank you for a interesting job.
Best.
Vladyslav.
