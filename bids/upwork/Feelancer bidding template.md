Hello, as PHP/MySQL expert, I can deliver the perfect result. $400 is good for me. You will see a perfect website in just a few days and that website will never lose a potential customer. Your website will remain competitive for years, and you won't have to upgrade your website. But if you do decide to upgrade your website, you won't have to find a new developer.

Your website will be fully responsive and visually appealing, you won't have to worry about mobile users, your website will be visited by more and more people, and your site will be the first thing that shows up when people Google it.

Here are two recent projects that I have done:
https://a16z.com/
https://css-tricks.com/

You will see something more beautiful and wonderful than the above site, and I will dedicate myself to making it the best.
I would like to discuss your project in more detail in the chat.
Best,
