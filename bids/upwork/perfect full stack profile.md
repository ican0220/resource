You can be sure that you are getting a top quality full stack developer who will communicate and work with you to achieve your goals. In my opinion, if you are not getting more than what you paid for, then I am not doing my job right.

I work hard to create clean, concise sites that are visually appealing but functional for the user. I consider the success of my business to be whether my work achieves my clientâ€™s intent. I put a lot of effort into reaching my target audience in the best possible way.

My clients call me a passionate and strong problem solver. You will see successful results throughout your engagement, you will know a reliable, long-term developer, and you will never have to look for a new developer for your business again.

My main skill sets:
- HTML/CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript
- Node.js, React, Next.js, Vue.js, Express.js
- PHP, Laravel
- Python, Django, Flask
- C#, ASP.net
- OpenAI, ChatGPT
- MySQL, MongoDB
- Git, GitHub
- AWS, Heroku, Vercel
- Agile Methodologies, Jira

I am available in all time zones and prefer to maintain ongoing relationships with my clients.
