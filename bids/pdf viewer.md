Hello, I am Brenton. I have strong confidence in your project and I can start the work immediately. Developing a web-based PDF viewer with annotation capabilities as an SDK for technical industries is a great idea. Below, I’ll outline a high-level approach to implementing this in Node.js, including key components and technologies you might want to consider.

1. Project Setup

a. Initialize Node.js Project

b. Install Required Packages
I will need several packages to create a PDF viewer and handle annotations. Some recommended packages include:

- Express: For creating a web server.
- PDF.js: A popular library for rendering PDFs in the browser.
- Socket.io: For real-time collaboration on annotations (if needed).
- Multer: For handling file uploads (if you want users to upload PDFs).

Install these packages:
npm install express pdfjs-dist socket.io multer
2. Create a Basic Server

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'index.html'));
});


3. Frontend Setup

Create an  `index.html`  file in a  `public`  folder to include PDF.js and your annotation functionality:
<!-- public/index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>PDF Viewer SDK</title>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/2.10.377/pdf.min.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <canvas id="pdf-canvas"></canvas>
    <script src="viewer.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
4. PDF Rendering with PDF.js

Create a  `viewer.js`  file to handle PDF rendering:
// public/viewer.js
const url = 'path/to/your/pdf/file.pdf'; // URL of the PDF file

const loadingTask = pdfjsLib.getDocument(url);
loadingTask.promise.then(pdf => {
    console.log('PDF loaded');

    // Fetch the first page
    pdf.getPage(1).then(page => {
        console.log('Page loaded');

        const scale = 1.5;
        const viewport = page.getViewport({ scale: scale });

        // Prepare canvas using PDF page dimensions
        const canvas = document.getElementById('pdf-canvas');
        const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
        canvas.height = viewport.height;
        canvas.width = viewport.width;

        // Render PDF page into canvas context
        const renderContext = {
            canvasContext: context,
            viewport: viewport
        };
        page.render(renderContext);
    });
}, reason => {
    console.error(reason);
});
5. Implementing Annotations

I can implement annotations by allowing users to draw or add notes on the PDF canvas. Here’s a basic approach:

a. Capture Mouse Events

Modify your  `viewer.js`  to capture mouse events for drawing annotations:
let isDrawing = false;
const annotations = [];

canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
    isDrawing = true;
    const rect = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
    const x = e.clientX - rect.left;
    const y = e.clientY - rect.top;
    annotations.push({ x, y });
});

canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
    if (!isDrawing) return;
    const rect = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
    const x = e.clientX - rect.left;
    const y = e.clientY - rect.top;
    const lastAnnotation = annotations[annotations.length - 1];
    const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
    context.beginPath();
    context.moveTo(lastAnnotation.x, lastAnnotation.y);
    context.lineTo(x, y);
    context.stroke();
    lastAnnotation.x = x;
    lastAnnotation.y = y;
});

canvas.addEventListener('mouseup', () => {
    isDrawing = false;
});
b. Save and Load Annotations

I can save annotations to a backend database (like MongoDB) or file system and load them when the PDF is opened. This will require additional API endpoints in your Express server.

6. Integrating External Annotations

To integrate annotations from Adobe PDFs or other sources, you will need to parse those annotations and convert them into your own format. This could involve:

- Reading the PDF metadata to extract existing annotations.
- Converting them into a format compatible with your viewer.

7. Deployment and SDK Packaging

Once your application is working:

- Package it as an SDK by creating a library that developers can import into their own projects.
- Consider documentation and examples to help other developers integrate your SDK into their applications.

8. Further Enhancements

- Real-time Collaboration: Use Socket.io to allow multiple users to annotate the same PDF in real-time.
- User Authentication: Implement user authentication if you want to manage user-specific annotations.
- Export Annotations: Allow users to export their annotations to various formats.

I can deliver the best result by following these steps. I hope to work with you for long time.
Thank you.
