Hello, I am Brenton. I can work on your project with my hourly rate $12. I can deliver the result with high quality within deadlines. I am excited about the opportunity to create a responsive HTML email based on your design. With my experience in crafting visually appealing and functional email templates, I can ensure that the email will render perfectly across different email clients, including Outlook, Gmail, and Apple Mail.

I have developed several responsive HTML emails, adhering to best practices for email coding (e.g., inline CSS, table-based layouts, etc.), ensuring compatibility across various clients and devices.
I understand the importance of pixel-perfect translation of designs into HTML and will maintain the integrity of your design.
Cross-Client Testing: I will ensure the email is tested across major clients to guarantee consistency and responsiveness.
I am committed to delivering high-quality work within the agreed timeline.
Please let me know if you'd like to discuss the project further.

My skills include:
-html, css, js
