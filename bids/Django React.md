I'm looking for a monthly compensation of approximately $2000 to 3000 USD based on my experience and the scope of responsibilities. This rate aligns with industry standards for full-stack roles with expertise in Django, Vue, TypeScript, and mobile frameworks like Ionic and Capacitor, and it reflects my commitment to delivering high-quality results. However, I'm open to discussing the budget to find a fair arrangement for both of us.

The hardest I’ve ever worked on a project was during the development of a high-traffic e-commerce platform that required 24/7 uptime during peak sales periods. I was the lead developer responsible for ensuring the backend’s stability and scalability while managing real-time updates and high-volume transactions. The timeline was extremely tight, so I worked long hours, optimizing database queries, implementing load balancers, and stress-testing the system.

I encountered unexpected scaling issues, so I had to troubleshoot under pressure, often diving into complex debugging sessions in the early hours. This experience pushed my problem-solving skills and endurance to the limit, but it taught me a lot about handling high-pressure environments and maintaining focus on quality even when speed was crucial. The project ultimately went live without a hitch, and it was one of the most rewarding challenges I've overcome.

E-commerce Platform (Vue, Django, TypeScript)

Role: Full-Stack Developer
Description: Built an e-commerce web application with a Vue.js frontend and a Django backend, leveraging TypeScript for type safety and scalability on the frontend. I developed the API endpoints in Django and set up real-time inventory updates using WebSockets.
Note: This project required extensive work in payment integration and user authentication, ensuring a secure, high-performance platform for online transactions.

If you've already installed Netdata but are having trouble identifying the cause of RAM spikes, there are several steps you can take within Netdata to get a clearer picture of which processes or applications are using up memory. Here's how to narrow down the cause:

1. Enable Detailed Memory Metrics
In Netdata, go to the Memory section on the left panel. Here, you can see breakdowns of memory usage by cache, buffers, active processes, and inactive processes.
Look for sudden increases in used memory, which may indicate a memory leak or a specific process that’s consuming more memory over time.
2. Monitor Individual Processes
Netdata provides a per-process breakdown under the “Applications” or “Processes” section.
Go to the System Overview > Applications section and look for the Top Processes by Memory Usage chart.
This chart shows which processes are using the most memory in real-time and can help you spot any unusual memory consumption from specific applications or services, such as php-fpm, nginx, mysql, or redis.
3. Identify Memory-Leaking Applications
If you see a process steadily increasing in memory usage over time, it may have a memory leak.
Pay particular attention to:
PHP-FPM (often used by Laravel): It’s common for misconfigured PHP processes to hold on to memory, especially if they’re not recycling correctly.
Redis: High data load or large datasets in Redis can cause spikes.
MySQL: Inefficient queries or a large buffer size can also spike RAM usage.
4. Inspect the Laravel Application
If the memory spikes correlate with periods of high activity in your Laravel application, it could be related to:
Large Database Queries: Track MySQL query load and cache usage to spot inefficient queries.
Cache Buildup in Redis: Clear or limit the cache storage if Redis is using too much memory.
Job Queue Issues: If you’re using Laravel Queues, monitor queue workers, as they may consume significant memory when handling large jobs or processing images/files.
5. Set Alerts for RAM Usage
You can configure Netdata to alert you when RAM usage exceeds a certain threshold.
Go to /etc/netdata/health.d/ram.conf and configure an alert like this:
yaml
Copy code
alarm:
  name: RAM_usage_high
  on: system.ram
  lookup: average -10s percentage
  units: %
  every: 10s
  warn: $this > 75
  crit: $this > 90
  info: "RAM usage is high"
  to: sysadmin
This will notify you whenever RAM usage is above the threshold, helping you catch memory spikes in real-time.
6. Run Diagnostic Commands (Optional)
If you need further analysis outside of Netdata, consider using:
top or htop: for real-time process memory usage.
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head: to list processes sorted by memory usage.
free -m: to check overall memory usage and swap usage.
7. Consider Swapping and Disk I/O
If there’s not enough physical RAM, the server may use swap space, which can slow down performance. Monitor Swap Usage in Netdata to check if spikes correspond to swap usage. High swap usage can indicate that more physical RAM is needed.
