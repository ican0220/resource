I have deep experience in developing custom WordPress themes from scratch, ensuring that the site is both fully functional and optimized for performance. I follow best practices in WordPress development, ensuring that the site is scalable, secure, and easy to manage post-launch.

I will build the site to be responsive across all devices, with smooth animations and fast load times.
I can implement custom functionalities, such as product pages, lead forms, or any specific elements required for your mobility scooters, in a way that enhances user experience.

In addition to developing beautiful websites, I ensure that the site is optimized for search engines and performance. This is critical for your brand’s visibility in the Dutch market.
I use tools like Yoast SEO for on-page optimization and WP Rocket or W3 Total Cache to improve load times, ensuring the site ranks well and performs flawlessly.

With Figma being a leading design tool, I have extensive experience in working directly from Figma files and ensuring that all design elements are translated exactly as envisioned by the designer.
I pay close attention to the design-to-development handoff, ensuring that font styles, spacing, and interactive elements like sliders or hover effects are implemented exactly as specified.

I value long-term partnerships, and I’m committed to ongoing support, whether for maintenance, feature updates, or scaling the website as the brand grows. I understand that launching a new brand involves more than just developing a website; it requires a developer who can support your vision over time and help you adapt to new challenges.

I can work on full time and I can star the work immediately. I hope to work with you.
Thank you.

I dont have enough connects. It may seem strange to you, but it's true to me.

I hate to work for something. I only work for my experiences and skills. I think I don't have enough experiences to manage accounts safely. And We grow the account, I don't have enough time to do it. I am urgent to get any job, and it might give account bad effects.
