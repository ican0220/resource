I am an experienced web developer with a strong background in using Alpine.js and Fabric.js to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. I have extensive experience working with Shopify, utilizing the CLI to manage projects efficiently, and I am very comfortable operating in a GIT-based development environment.

My skills include:
- html, css, js, php
- alpine.js, fabric.js
- shopify ,shopify cli
- git, github
- trello or jira

I have utilized Alpine.js to build responsive components that enhance user experience without the overhead of larger frameworks. My experience with Fabric.js includes creating and manipulating canvas elements, allowing for rich, interactive graphics and applications. I possess expert-level experience with Shopify, including theme customization, app integration, and leveraging the Shopify CLI for seamless development and deployment. I am proficient in using GIT for version control, including branching, merging, and collaborating on code in a team environment.

I thrive in collaborative environments and have experience working with teams in real-time during US business hours. I am skilled in using tools like Slack, Zoom, and GitHub to facilitate communication and ensure smooth collaboration on projects. For instance, I recently worked on a Shopify project where I integrated Alpine.js for frontend interactions and Fabric.js for custom canvas elements, enhancing the overall user experience. I collaborated closely with designers and developers to ensure project goals were met on time.

I am excited about the opportunity to support your team on this project and leverage my skills in Alpine.js, Fabric.js, and Shopify to deliver high-quality results. I look forward to collaborating and contributing to the team's success.

I can work on full time and I say on cutting edge and follow the recent trends of web developments. I can deliver the result with high quality within deadlines. I hope to work with you.
Thank you.
