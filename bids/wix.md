This is my recent work.
You can check my Wix skills from this url.
I can create a responsive and user-friendly design based on Figma file. For this, I was based on Editor X.
And I integrated several functions using Velo.

My skills include:
Wix Editor: The visual builder for creating your site.
Velo by Wix: A development platform that allows you to add custom code and functionality to your Wix site.
JavaScript: The primary programming language used for client-side scripting and interacting with the Wix API and backend.
Wix Fetch: A built-in library for making HTTP requests to third-party APIs.
Third-Party APIs: Any external API that you want to integrate, such as payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal), data services (Weather API, News API), or any custom API you have access to.

I follow the following steps to integrate third party apis.
Step 1: Enable Velo by Wix
Open Wix studio
Go to Dev Mode at the top of the editor and turn it on. This enables Velo features.
Step 2: Identify the API you want to integrate. Review its documentation to understand the endpoints, request methods (GET, POST, etc.), and any required authentication (API keys, OAuth, etc.).
any necessary credentials, like API keys or access tokens.
Step 3: Create a Backend Function
In the Velo sidebar, click on the Backend section.
Right-click on the backend folder and select New File to create a new file (e.g., api.jsw).
Add the code to make API requests. Hereâ€™s a basic example using fetch:
Step 4: Call the Backend Function from the Frontend
In page's code, import the backend function you created and call it when needed, for example on a button click or page load:
Step 5: Display the Data
Add elements to Wix page (like a text box or a repeater) to display the data fetched from the API.
Update these elements in your code based on the data received.
