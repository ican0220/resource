Hello, I can fix CORS error with my hourly rate 12. I have extensive experiences and skills in CORS Policy. I follow the following steps to fix current CORS error.

1. Identify the Issue with Network Requests:
Check the Console/Network Tab: Open the browser's developer tools (F12), go to the "Network" tab, and inspect the failed requests.
2. Update Server Configuration:
Ensure the following headers are configured correctly:
-Access-Control-Allow-Origin
-Access-Control-Allow-Methods
-Access-Control-Allow-Headers 
-Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
3. Temporary API Response Modification (if needed):
To bypass the error temporarily, you could:
Set a wildcard origin (*) for local testing, allowing all domains. Make sure to restrict it for production.
4. Server-Specific Configuration:
Depending on the server you use, configure CORS:
I can set by other ways according to several platforms.
5. Documentation:
Once the fix is applied:
Document the exact changes to the server configuration and any modifications to the API responses.

I can start the work right now. I can deliver the result with high quality as quickly as possible. I hope to work with you.
Thank you
Which server are you using now, node.js or python, and or php ?


In a recent project, I encountered a CORS error after a server upgrade when the frontend, built with React, started making requests to an external API. The error message indicated that the preflight request (OPTIONS) was failing due to incorrect handling of CORS headers.

To resolve the issue, I first analyzed the network requests using the browser's developer tools, confirming that the preflight request was not returning the expected 200 status. I then reviewed the server configuration and identified that the Access-Control-Allow-Origin and Access-Control-Allow-Methods headers were missing from the preflight response.

After updating the server to properly handle OPTIONS requests, I added the necessary headers, including Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods, and Access-Control-Allow-Headers. I also ensured that Access-Control-Allow-Credentials was set correctly for requests that required authentication tokens.

Temporary modifications were made to allow all origins during development, followed by restricting it to specific origins in production. I thoroughly tested the solution using Postman and browser tools, confirming that the CORS issue was resolved.
