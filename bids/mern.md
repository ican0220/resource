Hello, $15 - This is my hourly rate.  
If you are seeking a talented full stack expert to join your team, I am very fit at this position. As an expert who has experiences of 5 over years, I can work on your project with hourly rate $15 for long time. I have good communication skills and I can communicate with you at any time. I am a detail-oriented developer, and I create the user-friendly and visual appealing design. I have deep understanding in pixel-perfect and responsive design.

My main stacks are React/Next.js/Express.js/TypeScript.
In previous works, I used lazy image optimization, server side rendering that is main feature in next.js, and hook functions like useMemo, useCallback. And I implemented routes using app router and page router in next.js. And I created responsive and user friendly frontend using TailwindCSS.

Prisma is an open-source ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for Node.js and TypeScript and in my previous content management application, Prisma was used to manage CRUD operations for data (like users, posts, comments) with ease, helping me to scale databases without deep SQL knowledge.

Pinecone is a fully managed vector database service designed for high-performance similarity search and large-scale machine learning. Itâ€™s optimized for vector data, often used in applications involving machine learning, NLP, and recommendation systems. In my previous works, I could store vector embeddings of user behavior or item features in Pinecone.

While Prisma and Pinecone serve different purposes (structured data and vector data), they complement each other in applications where structured data and machine-learning-driven recommendations are both critical.
