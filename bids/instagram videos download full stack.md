Hello, as a senior web/ai developer, I can complete your Wep app with you successfully. Creating a web application that downloads Instagram videos, records metrics, and transcribes the content involves several steps, technologies, and considerations I follow the development process, along with a rough timeline.

Development Process
1. Requirements Gathering (1-2 days)*
   - Define the exact features and specifications (e.g., number of profiles, time frame for videos). 
   - Understand Instagramâ€™s API limitations and scraping policies. 
   - Determine how you will transcribe videos (e.g., using speech-to-text APIs). 
 
2. Technology Stack Selection (1 to 2 days) 
   - Frontend: Framework like React, Vue.js, or Angular for the user interface. 
   - Backend: Node.js, Python (Flask/Django), or Ruby on Rails to handle the logic. 
   - Database: A lightweight database like SQLite or a NoSQL database like MongoDB for temporary storage. 
   - APIs: Use Instagram Graph API (if applicable) or a web scraping library like Beautiful Soup (Python) or Puppeteer (Node.js). 
   - Transcription: Use a speech-to-text API like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, IBM Watson, or Azure Speech Service. 
 
3. Design Phase () 
   I am not designer, so I can not confirm. 
 
4. Development (2 weeks) 
   - Frontend Development: Build the user interface, allowing users to input Instagram profiles and the number of days. (2 to 3 days)
   - Backend Development: Implement logic to: (1 week)
     - Fetch videos from Instagram profiles (using API or scraping). 
     - Record metrics (like count, view count, comment count). 
     - Download videos to the server. 
     - Transcribe videos and save results. 
   - CSV Generation: Implement functionality to create and download a CSV file with the required data. 
 
5. Testing (1 week)*
   - Perform unit testing and integration testing of each component. 
   - Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure the application meets user needs. 
   - Fix bugs and refine features based on feedback. 
 
6. Deployment (1 weeks) 
   - Choose a hosting service (AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean). 
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment. 
   - Launch the application for public use.
