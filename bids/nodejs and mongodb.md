Hello, as a senior web developer, I can complete your Wep app with you successfully.To develop a backend service using Node.js and TypeScript that meets the specified key features, I follow the following development process

1. Set up Environment and  Create Project Structure
- install typescript, ts-node, express modules.
- create project structure.
