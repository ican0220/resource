Google Sheets.
Hello, although I have not earned over $1000 yet, I can complete your Tool with high quality within 4 to 5 days. I have extensive experiences and skills in React.js/Next.js and Google Sheet integration. Developing an internal tool that replicates the features of your existing Organizational Checkup tool while integrating with Google Sheets and using React for the frontend is a structured process. 

I demonstrate my approach to reach with your requirements.
Step 1: Project Setup
1. Initialize the Project:
   - Create a new directory for your project.
   - Use Create React App to set up the React frontend:
2. Install Required Packages:
   - Install Axios for making HTTP requests and any charting library you choose
Step 2: Google Sheets Setup
1. Create a Google Sheet:
   - Create a Google Sheet to store questions and responses.
   - Set up a structure for the questions and responses. For example, one sheet for questions and another for user responses.
2. Enable Google Sheets API:
   - Go to the Google Cloud Console.
   - Create a new project and enable the Google Sheets API.
   - Create credentials (OAuth 2.0 Client IDs) for your application.
3. Set Up Google Sheets Access:
   - Share the Google Sheet with the service account email generated in the credentials step.
Step 3: Backend Integration
1. Create a Backend Service:
   - You can use Node.js and Express to create a simple backend service that interacts with Google Sheets.
   - Install necessary packages:
2. Set Up Google Sheets API in the Backend:
   - Create an Express server and set up routes to handle fetching questions and submitting responses.
Step 4: React Frontend Development
1. Create Components:
   - Create components for the question form, results page, and authentication.
2. Fetch Questions:
   - Use Axios to fetch questions from your backend when the component mounts.
Step 5: Result Page and Data Visualization
1. Create the Result Page:
   - Create a new component for displaying the summary and pie chart.
2. Fetch User Responses:
   - Implement a function to fetch user responses and visualize them using Chart.js.
Step 6: Implement Google OAuth Authentication
1. Set Up Google OAuth:
   - Use a library like  `react-google-login`  or implement your own OAuth flow.
   - Install the package:
2. Configure Authentication:
   - Create a login component to handle Google OAuth login.

My skills include:
- frontend: react.js, chart.js, axios
- backend: node.js, express.js, google sheets api
- authentication: google oauth
- database: google sheets
- deployment: heroku/asw for backend, vercel/netlify for frontend

I am genuinely excited about the possibility of working on this project and believe that my skills align well with your needs. I am eager to contribute to the success of your internal tool and support your team in achieving its goals. 
 
I can work on full time, and I can deliver the result with high quality within deadlines. I hope to work with you.
Thank you.

Overall, I think it covers the essential components needed for the internal tool effectively. However, I have a few suggestions that might enhance the project
-Framework choice: I think next.js is the better choice than react.js due to server side rendering and typescript features.
-Deployment: I think we can deploy this project in several deploy platforms like Heroku or AWS.
