Hello
Good day! I see you are looking a reliable senior Django web developer to develop a rules-based expert system that uses decision tree logic for case incident management.

I realized that I should have strong eye to design, willingess to work on fun projects, deliver quick results in your Django projects, I am very confident in your projects.

Here are my previous works. You can check my previous works from these live sites.

My GitHub account is https://github.com/softdev019

My skills include:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP
- React and Next.js
- Prisma, Shad 
- Git, GitHub and GitLab
- Jira

I can write well-documented code, and well-structured, maintainable and updatable code. I can solve security problems in writing smart contracts. I can work with a team, and I can do daily reports. I can deliver the rapid results, and I am a hard worker. I can work on your time zones and I can work on full time.

Think twice, code one.
I write the code that human understands, but I don't write code that machine understands.
I follow these sentences.

Thank you for a interesting job.
Best.
Vladyslav.

In a remote environment, I prioritize clear and consistent communication with stakeholders. I usually begin by setting expectations for updates and agreeing on communication channels. I provide regular progress reports, either daily reports or at key project milestones. I am good at project management tools like Jira.

For unit testing, I typically use Jest because of its seamless integration with Vue components and its extensive mocking capabilities, which are essential for isolated component tests. Additionally, I set up CI/CD pipelines with tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to automatically run tests on each pull request, which helps catch issues early and maintain high code standards.
