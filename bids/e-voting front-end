Hello, Omar.
Good day! I see you are looking a senior front-end developer to build modern front-end and to integrate it into Django backend for e-voting system. 
I think CI/CD development, responsive and modern frontend are very important for your project. I believe my 5+ years of experience and technology make me a very suitable front-end dev to implement this features.

Here are my previous works. You can check my previous works from these live sites.

My GitHub account is https://github.com/naturedevs. You can see many similar projects.

My skills include:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP
- React.js, Next.js and Vue.js
- Django and Laravel
- Git, GitHub and GitLab
- Jira

I think you had good job of explaining about your job, but I have some questions.
1. Do you have any design like Figma for your project for breakdown?
2. Which framework should I use to develop the front-end?

I am ready to discuss more details about your project at anytime. 
Thank you for a interesting job.
Best.
Vladyslav.
