Hello, I can clone google image search engin with my budget $70 within a few times. I have extensive experiences and skills in react.js and next.js
I can create responsive and user-friendly design. I use Tailwindcss and its grid, and implement popup when clicking image.

My recent previous works:
- https://oasis-main-sigma.vercel.app

My skills include:
- html, css, js, ts
- react.js and next.js
- tailwindcss
- git, github and gitlab

I can start the work right now. I can deliver the result with high quality within deadlines. I hope to work with you.
Thank you.
