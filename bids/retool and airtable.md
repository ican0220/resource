Hello, I can help you with my hourly rate $15 so that you can set up mini app. I have extensive experiences in retool and airtable.
I can create user-friendly and visual appealing frontend and integrate it with airtable. I can deliver the result with high quality as quickly as possible.

My general approach to develope your mini retool app contains the following steps:

1. Sign up and Sign in retool site.
2. Create a new app
  create a new app on retool dashboard.
3. Connect to Airtable.
 add resource and configure and save it.
4. Build your mini app interface.

- Drag and Drop Components: Retool provides a variety of UI components (tables, forms, buttons, charts, etc.). Drag and drop the components you need onto the canvas.
- Configure Components: Click on each component to configure its properties (like data source, labels, styles, etc.). For example, you can bind a table to a query that fetches data from your database.
- Layout: Arrange your components to create a user-friendly layout. You can use grids, containers, and other layout tools provided by Retool.

5. Write Queries
 create queries and manipulate with data with javascript or built-in languages and test that.

6. Add Logic and Interactivity

 - Event Handlers: add event handlers.
 - Conditional Logic: Use Retoolâ€™s JavaScript capabilities to implement conditional logic based on user input or query results.
7. Deploy Your App
 set options on dashboard and share your app.

I can start the work right now. I am ready to devote myself to complete your app. I hope to work with you.
Thank you.
