Hello, I can upgrade your Umbraco site to version 13. I can deliver the result with high quality as quickly as possible. I have extensive experiences in Umbraco and .net frameworks. Upgrading an Umbraco site from version 9.5.4 to version 13 requires careful planning and execution, as there are significant changes between these versions. I follow the following steps.


1.Backup Site
 - Backup  Database: Ensure a full backup of  database.
 - Backup Files: Make a copy of site files, including the  `wwwroot` ,  `App_Data` , and any custom code.
2. Assess  Current Implementation
- Document Types: Note that existing document types (17 in total) will need to be checked for any breaking changes in property editors or data types.
- Nested Content: Since you are okay with leaving nested content as is, I donâ€™t need to convert them to blocks.
- Controllers and Helpers: Review  existing controllers and helpers for any deprecated methods or changes in the API.
3. Upgrade to Umbraco 13
Finally, upgrade  site to Umbraco 13.
 - Update NuGet Packages: Update the Umbraco packages to version 13.x:
Update-Package Umbraco.Cms -Version 13.*
 - Review Breaking Changes: Check the [Umbraco 13 Breaking Changes]for any code adjustments.
 - Run Migrations: Start  application to allow Umbraco to perform any required migrations.
 - Test  Site: Thoroughly test  website functionality, including document types, nested content, controllers, and any other 
 custom code.

My skills include:
- html, css, js, ts, c#
- .net frameworks, especially in Umbraco CMS and ASP.net MVC
- MySQL and PostgreSQL
- bootstrap and jquery
- git, github and gitlab

I can start the work right now. I can work on full time. I can devote myself to complete your project once I started. I hope to work with you.
Thank you.
