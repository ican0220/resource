Hello, I can complete your website with my budget $400 within 1 week. I have extensive experiences and skills in website developments like React.js/Express.js. Developing a website that showcases sunflower oil products, allows customers to place orders online, integrates delivery methods, processes payments, and provides customer support can be accomplished using Node.js, Express.js, and React.js. I can follow the following steps.

Step 1: Project Setup

1. Initialize the Project:
   - Create a new directory for your project.
   - Use  `npm init`  to create a  `package.json`  file.
2. Set Up the Backend:
   - Install Express.js:
npm install express
    - Set up a basic server in  `server.js` :
3. Set Up the Frontend:
   - Create a new React app using Create React App:
npx create-react-app client
    - Navigate to the  `client`  directory and install Axios for making HTTP requests:
cd client
     npm install axios

Step 2: Design the Database
1. Choose a Database:*
   - Use MongoDB (with Mongoose) or PostgreSQL (with Sequelize) to store product information, orders, and user data.
2. Define Schemas:
   - For MongoDB, you can create models for Products, Orders, and Users.
Step 3: Implement RESTful API
1. Create Routes:
   - Set up routes for products, orders, and payments in your Express app.
2. Handle Orders:
   - Create a POST route to handle order submissions.
3. Integrate Payment Processing:
   - Use Stripe for payment processing. Install the Stripe package:
npm install stripe
- Set up a route to create a payment intent.

Step 4: Develop the Frontend
1. Create Components:
   - Develop components for displaying products, a shopping cart, and a checkout page.
2. Fetch Data:
   - Use Axios to fetch product data from your backend API.
3. Implement Order Functionality:
   - Create forms for users to place orders and handle the submission process.

Step 5: Delivery Options and Support
1. Delivery Options:
   - Create a selection component for delivery methods (home delivery or pickup) during the checkout process.
2.Contact Support:*
   - Implement a simple contact form and set up an endpoint to handle inquiries.

Step 6: Testing and Deployment
1. Testing:
   - Thoroughly test the application for bugs and ensure that the payment processing works correctly.
2. Deployment:
   - Deploy the backend (Node.js) to platforms like Heroku or AWS.
   - Deploy the frontend (React) to services like Vercel or Netlify.

With 5 years of experience in front-end development, I have a strong background in translating complex design structures into responsive and efficient web pages. I have worked extensively with Figma, ensuring that the final output maintains the integrity of the original design while adhering to best practices in HTML and CSS.

I can work on full time and I can deliver the result with high quality within deadlines. I CAN START THE WORK RIGHT NOW.
 
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of working together!
