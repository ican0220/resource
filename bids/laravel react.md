My skills include:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP
- AlpineJS and JQuery
- Laravel, Livewire
- React and Vue.js
- Figma
- Git, GitHub and GitLab
- Jira
- AWS and Heroku

I can write well-documented code, and well-structured, maintainable and updatable code. I can do daily reports. I can deliver the rapid results, and I am a hard worker. I can work on your time zone and I can work on full time.

I think you had good job of explaining about your job, but I have a question.
In current, your demo site was built only in Laravel and Bootstrap. But are you going to use React as front-end?

I am ready to discuss more details about your project at anytime. 
Thank you for a interesting job.
Best.
Vladyslav.
