Hello
Good day! I see you are looking a reliable Next.js developer to apply new designs to your web application.

I think combination of React as front-end and Flask as back-end is the best choice. React is morden website developments framework, and Flask is based on Python, so it provides many features and functions.

I have experience in React and Flask, and I have a lot of experience in Next.js. Of course, React is good framework, but it is not good at Search Engin Optimization. So I suggest Next.js framework. Next.js supports SEO using Server-Side Rendering. 

Here are my previous works. You can check my previous works from these live sites.

My skills include:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python
- React.js, Next.js and Vue.js
- Flask and Django
- MongoDB and MySQL
- Prisma, Shad, Figma
- Git, GitHub and GitLab
- Jira

I can write well-documented code, and well-structured, maintainable and updatable code. I can work with a team, and I can do daily reports. I can deliver the rapid results, and I am a hard worker. I can work on your time zone and I can work on full time.

Thank you for a interesting job.
Feel free to have a call with me any time.
Best.
Vladyslav.
