Hi SaschaðŸ˜€
You can see perfect and satisfactory Desktop application in a few hours and that application will work well according to all requirements. I am 100% confident in this project and understand that I need to build a local desktop application for students profiling and data.

You can have a beautiful desktop application developed with PyQT or QT, MFC and it will remain competitive for years and you will not have to upgrade your application. But even if you decide to upgrade your application, you will not have to find a new developer.

During this contract, you will get to know a reliable deveoper to work with you for long time.

Here is my approach to reach out with your requirements.
1. Define the core features
 There might be student enrollment, class representation, data retrieval, data storage and user-friendly interface in core features.
2. Tech Stack selection
- programming languages: python, c, c++
- framework:
  GUI: QT, PyQT, and MFC
  Database: SQLite
3. Design the application workflow
- student enrollment:
   a from to collect personal and academic details
   file uploader for supporting documents
   save the data to the SQLite databse and store files  in a folder.
- class representation:
   use a tree map or grid view to display students grouped by class.
   allow clicking on a student node to view their profile.
- data retrieval
   search bar with filters
   display results in a list or table format
   open and display student files.
4. Develpment:
I will create sql, python codes to perform the core features.

I am ready to start working right away, I am an independent developer. I am not in a hurry right now so I can devote myself to completing your project. I would like to discuss more in chat.

Thanks.
Vladyslav
