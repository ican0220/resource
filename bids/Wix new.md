Hello
Good day! I see you are looking a reliable senior Wix developer to help redesign your website and resolve existing issues.

I think I should have enough experineces, good problem solving skills, good communication skills, and I should be detail-oriented dev.

I can create the responsive and user-friendly wix front-end. There are tow choices to build Wix webiste - Wix Editor and Editor X. Editor X is newer than Wix Editor, and it provides responsive and user-friendly design tools. So I can build your website using Editor X successfully.

Hello, I will troubleshoot the integration between 3CX and Twilio. Your fist error occurs when Twilio can not reach your webhook URL. For checking this error, I will check Webhook URL configuration, verifying 3CX settings, and Test webhook accessibility.

Your second error suggests the phone number format isn't correct. For fixing this error, I will check the number format in 3CX, update Twilio SIP domain settings, verifing SIP trunck configuration in 3CX.

Let's start quickly. Thank you.
Julio.
