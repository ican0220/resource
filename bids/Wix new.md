Hello
Good day! I see you are looking a reliable senior Wix developer to help redesign your website and resolve existing issues.

I think I should have enough experineces, good problem solving skills, good communication skills, and I should be detail-oriented dev.

I can create the responsive and user-friendly wix front-end. There are tow choices to build Wix webiste - Wix Editor and Editor X. Editor X is newer than Wix Editor, and it provides responsive and user-friendly design tools. So I can build your website using Editor X successfully.
