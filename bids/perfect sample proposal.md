Hello, RachelðŸ˜Š
You will see that I have created a perfect website in just a few days and that website will never lose a potential customer. I think you can make a lot of money from that website and your business will grow significantly. During this contract period, you will get to know a talented and reliable developer who will help you with your business in the long term.

You can have a beautiful website developed with Laravel on the backend and React on the frontend, and it will remain competitive for years, and you won't have to upgrade your website. But if you do decide to upgrade your website, you won't have to find a new developer.

Your website will be fully responsive and visually appealing, you won't have to worry about mobile users, your website will be visited by more and more people, and your site will be the first thing that shows up when people Google it.

Here are two recent projects that I have done:
- https://indatalabs.com/services/virtual-assistant-tool-development
- https://www.ai-captures.com/
You will see something more beautiful and wonderful than the above site, and I will dedicate myself to making it the best.

My skills include:
- HMTL/CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP
- React, Next.js
- Laravel
- MySQL and Firebase
- AWS, Google Cloud
- Jira and Zoho
- Git, GitHub

I think you did good job description, but I have a question.
Do you have a technical guide or do you leave it up to me to build the website according to what you have described?

I would like to discuss your project in more detail in the chat.
Best,
Vladyslav.
