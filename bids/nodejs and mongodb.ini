Hello, I work on your Node.js/MongoDB project with my hourly rate $15. I have extensive experiences and skills in Node.js/Express and MongoDB. I can uploaded my previous works. It developed using Express.js and MongoDB. You can check my skills and experiences from it. 

I can work on full time and I can work more thant 30 hours a week. I have not any task now. I am ready to start the work right now. I focus on well structured, maintainable and updatable backend developments and also I focus on optimizing the performance and quality. 

I have good communication skills and abilities working with a team. I can work on your project for long time - if you like me. 

Building a CRUD application with Node.js, MongoDB, and TypeScript, along with Excel file import/export functionality, is a great project!
I follow the following steps.

1.Set Up Your Development Environment
 - Install Node.js and npm: 
 - Install MongoDB: 
 - Initialize a new Node.js project:
    npm init -y
 - Install necessary packages:
    npm install express mongoose multer xlsx dotenv
   npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node @types/express @types/multer @types/xlsx ts-node
 - Initialize TypeScript**:
    npx tsc --init
2. Set Up the Project Structure
Create the following directory structure:
ecommerce-inventory/
│
├── src/
│   ├── controllers/
│   │   └── itemController.ts
│   ├── models/
│   │   └── Item.ts
│   ├── routes/
│   │   └── itemRoutes.ts
│   ├── config/
│   │   └── db.ts
│   ├── utils/
│   │   └── excelUtils.ts
│   └── server.ts
│
├── .env
└── package.json
3. Configure MongoDB Connection
Create a file named  `db.ts`  in the  `src/config/`  directory to handle the database connection.
4. Create the Item Model
Create a file named  `Item.ts`  in the  `src/models/`  directory.
5. Create the Item Controller
Create a file named  `itemController.ts`  in the  `src/controllers/`  directory.
6. Create the Routes
Create a file named  `itemRoutes.ts`  in the  `src/routes/`  directory.
7. Excel File Import/Export Utility
Create a file named  `excelUtils.ts`  in the  `src/utils/`  directory.
8.Create a  `.env`  File
Create a  `.env`  file in the root of your project to store your environment variables.
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ecommerce-inventory
PORT=5000
9. Hosting on an Ubuntu Linux VM
 - Set up your Ubuntu server**: Make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your server.
 - Copy your project files to the server**: You can use  `scp`  or any other method to transfer files.
 - Install dependencies on the server**:
    npm install
 - Run your application**: You might want to use a process manager like PM2 to keep your application running.
    npm install -g pm2
   pm2 start src/server.ts --name ecommerce-inventory
 - Set up Nginx (optional)**: If you want to serve your application via a domain, set up Nginx as a reverse proxy.

 My skills include:
- backend skills: node.js, express.js, mongodb, mongoose, typescript
- file handling: multer and xlsx
- hosting: ubuntu linux, service like aws, Nginx
- postman
- git, github and gitlab
- jira and agile

I have good understanding about all processes of website development, and I follow the most effective methodology for delivering the result. I am hard worker and passionate of web development. If you give this task, I will devote myself to complete this task successfully. I hope to work with you.
Thank you.
