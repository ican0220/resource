Hello, $1000 is good for me and 1 month is much for me. I am sure you will get satisfactory results during the contract. Your website will be fully responsive and visually appealing, you won't have to worry about mobile users, your website will be visited by more and more people, and your site will be the first thing that shows up when people Google it.

I have recently developed the following projects:

I can deliver the result with high quality within deadlines. I have confident in your project. I hope to work with you.
