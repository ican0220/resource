Hello, I can complete your project with my budget $500. I have extensive experience working with both Softr and Supabase, leveraging these tools to build robust and dynamic web applications. My expertise with Softr includes designing custom interfaces, creating data-driven applications, and integrating various functionalities like user authentication and automation. I've successfully implemented complex workflows, such as displaying data from Supabase, managing real-time updates, and setting up interactive features like form submissions and conditional actions.

With Supabase, I’m proficient in structuring and managing databases, working with Supabase's API, and seamlessly integrating it into Softr to provide real-time data visualization. This has allowed me to build scalable solutions where users can easily interact with data, view detailed records, and trigger specific actions—all within a user-friendly interface. My skill set includes optimizing these integrations to ensure performance, security, and ease of use for both end-users and administrators.
