Hello, I am Vladyslav. I can work on your project as full time developer and I can start the work immediately. I have recently developed similar project: I uploaded relevant code. I worked as front-end developer, I implemented responsive and user-friendly design using bootstrap, jquery and media, and I integrated front-end and api endpoints .To develop a .NET Blazor project and optimizing frontend designs for speed and performance, I can follow a structured approach

Step 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment
 - Create a New Blazor Project:

Step 2: Developing the Application
1. Create Responsive Layouts:
   - Use CSS Grid and Flexbox to create responsive designs. Blazor components can be styled using CSS, so ensure your styles are mobile-friendly.
   - Consider using a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS to speed up the styling process.
2. Implement Animations:
   - Use CSS animations and transitions to create smooth animations for your components. For more complex animations, consider using JavaScript libraries like GSAP or the built-in Blazor animation capabilities.
3. Optimize Frontend Components:
   - Use Blazor’s component model to break down your UI into reusable components. This will help with organization and performance.
   - Implement lazy loading for components that are not immediately needed to improve initial load times.
   - Use the  `@key`  directive in Blazor to optimize rendering when lists of components are updated.
4. Integrate with Backend Systems:
   - Use Blazor’s built-in HTTP client to communicate with your backend APIs. Ensure that you handle API responses efficiently and update the UI accordingly.

Step 3: Performance Optimization
1. Optimize Images and Assets:
   - Use image formats like WebP for better compression and faster loading times. Implement lazy loading for images.
   - Minimize CSS and JavaScript files using tools like Webpack or built-in features in Visual Studio.
2. Analyze Performance:
   - Use browser developer tools to analyze the performance of your application. Look for opportunities to reduce render times and improve responsiveness.
   - Consider using tools like Lighthouse to assess performance and receive recommendations.
3. Cross-Browser Compatibility:
   - Test your application across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) to ensure compatibility.
   - Use tools like BrowserStack or CrossBrowserTesting for comprehensive testing if you don’t have access to all browsers.

My Blazor app:
- https://gestion2.softsgs.net

My skills include:
- Frontend: blazor, html/css, javascript, css frameworks.
- Backend: .net core, c#, mysql, postresql
- git, github and gitlab

By following these steps, I can effectively develop a .NET Blazor project that emphasizes animations and frontend optimization. Focus on creating a responsive and high-performance application while ensuring a smooth user experience.

I can work on full time and I can deliver the result as quickly as possible. I will devote myself to complete this task once I work on this project. I hope to work with you.
Thank you.
