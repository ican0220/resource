Hello, I can complete your Vue.js/Nuxt.js landing page website within 1 to 2 days timeframe. I can deliver the responsive and visual appealing website. I can ensure the performance optimization and SEO optimization. I can follow your team specifications with high quality. I have extensive experiences in Vue.js and Nuxt.js.

My considerations to develope websites:
 - Component-Based Architecture: Break down UI into reusable Vue components. This promotes modularity and reusability. 
 - Responsive Design: Use CSS Flexbox or Grid, and media queries to ensure your site looks good on all devices. 
 - Implement Routing: Use Nuxt.js's built-in routing to manage pages and navigation easily. 
 - State Management: Utilize Vuex for state management if your application requires shared state across components. 
 - Lazy Loading: Implement lazy loading for images and components to improve initial load times. 
 - Code Splitting: Use Nuxt.js's automatic code splitting to ensure users only load the necessary code for the page they are    visiting. 
 - Minification and Compression: Ensure your CSS and JavaScript files are minified. Use tools like gzip or Brotli for  compression. 

I can develop high-quality, responsive landing pages and websites with a focus on speed and precision. I am ready to start the work right now. I hope to work with you for long time.
Thank you.
