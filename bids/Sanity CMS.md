Hello, I can debug your error as quickly as possible. When you successfully publish a post programmatically to Sanity CMS but do not see it appear in Sanity Studio, there could be several reasons for this issue.I am going to consider the following items.

1. Check for Drafts
   - Sanity uses a draft and published version mechanism. Ensure that the post is published and not just saved as a draft. In Sanity, there are two states for documents: draft (unpublished) and published. If you only have a draft, it wonâ€™t appear in the published view.
2. Review Permissions
   - Ensure that your API token has the necessary permissions to publish documents. If you are using a token with limited permissions, it may not allow publishing.
3. Inspect the Document Structure
   - Verify that the document you are trying to publish conforms to your schema. If there are validation errors or missing required fields, the document might not be published even if the transaction ID is returned.
4. Check the Document Status
   - After publishing, check the status of the document using the Sanity CLI or API. You can use the following command to fetch the document:
sanity documents get <document-id>
- This will help you confirm if the document is indeed published and if there are any issues with its content.
5. Look for Errors in the Response
   - Even if you receive a successful transaction ID, check the response for any warnings or errors that might indicate what went wrong.
6. Inspect the Sanity Studio Configuration
   - Sometimes, the Sanity Studio configuration might filter out certain documents based on user roles or custom queries. Ensure that your document is not being filtered out due to visibility settings.
I will check these all items, and find out the reason exactly. And I will solve this problem successfully. 
I uploaded my sample code based on javascript to post programmatically to Sanity CMS. Of course, it is example code. If you use python, it is ok.
I can start the work right now. I hope to work with you.
Thank you.
