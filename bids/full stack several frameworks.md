    My English level is fluent. I am highly proficient in written communication, which allows me to effectively collaborate with teams, understand project requirements, and provide detailed documentation or feedback. 
• What Front end language are you strongest in?
    I am strongest in React.js, Next.js and Vue.js as a front-end language. I have extensive experience building dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces using React's component-based architecture. I am also proficient with related technologies such as Next.js for server-side rendering and Redux for state management, which further enhance my ability to create seamless and scalable front-end applications. My expertise in React allows me to efficiently develop applications with high performance, interactivity, and maintainable code.
• What Backend language are you strongest in?
    I am strongest in Node.js for back-end development. I have significant experience building scalable RESTful APIs, real-time applications, and handling server-side logic using Node.js. Additionally, I am well-versed in Express.js for creating robust web servers and managing databases with MongoDB and MySQL. My expertise in asynchronous programming and handling API integrations ensures efficient back-end operations for various types of applications.

    Alongside Node.js, I also have solid experience with Python/Django, which I use for more structured and complex business logic when required.
    
My skills include:
- frontend: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, Vue.js and Angular.

- database: mongodb, mysql and postgresql
- CI/CD: git, github and gitlab
- Agile methodologies: Scrum, Jira and Airtable

I create a responsive and pixel perfect front-end based on mock up designs like Figma, XD and PSD, and also I can clone the websites from references sites. This has advantages to save the money for design. I implement the effective state management and visual appealing design.

I write reusable, updatable and maintainable code and I am responsive for my results in future. I am good at REST api and GraphQL, and I create optimized endpoints. I design and implement the effective databases and table, and I can optimize the performance. And I am good at several databases like SQL and NoSQL.

I have extensive experiences and skills in api integration between frontend and backend, and I have implemented third party integrations like email system, stripe integration and chatGPT.

I have deep understanding in agile and scrum methodologies, and I can manage the project based on git and Jira.

I have good communication skills and abilities for working with a cross functional team. I can contact my clients anytime and I can deliver the result with high quality within deadlines. I can keep good long term relationship with my clients. I hope to contribute myself to your projects. I am hard worker and I can work on full time.
