Hello, I can work on your React/node.js project with my hourly rate $15. I have strong background and enough experiences in React.j/node.js

I have experiences in the following features.
  - Designed, developed, and maintained client-facing applications using React, achieving a increase in engagement.
  - Built and optimized RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express.js, reducing response time 
  - Collaborated with designers and product managers to implement user-friendly interfaces and ensure seamless integration between frontend and backend.
  - Implemented unit and integration tests, increasing code coverage .

In my previous role, I developed a React application that improved user engagement by 30% through enhanced UI/UX design.

My considerations to complete React project:
- responsive and visual appealing front-end design.
- reusable components
- functional components and Hook functions like useMemo and useCallback
- state management using Redux
- well structured, maintainable and reusable backend code.
