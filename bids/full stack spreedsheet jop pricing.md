Hello, I can complete your estimating system with my hourly rate $20. Developing an estimating system that integrates with a spreadsheet for quick job pricing and generates detailed scopes of work is a great project. I follow the following steps:

Step 1: Define Requirements
1. Identify Features:
   - Ability to upload/select a spreadsheet (e.g., Excel or CSV).
   - User interface for selecting items from the spreadsheet.
   - Generate a detailed scope of work based on selected items.
   - Provide a summary of costs and estimates.
   - User-friendly design.
2. Determine Data Structure:
   - Define how the data in the spreadsheet will be structured (e.g., columns for item name, description, cost, etc.).
Step 2: Choose Technology Stack
- Backend: 
  - Python: Use Flask or Django for building the web application.
  - PHP: Use Laravel or a simple PHP script for handling backend logic.
- Frontend:
  - Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (possibly with a framework like React or Vue.js) for the user interface.
-*Database: 
  - Use MySQL, or PostgreSQL to store user selections and estimates.
Step 3: Develop the Application
1. Backend Development:
   - File Upload: Create an endpoint to upload the spreadsheet.
   - Data Processing: Read the spreadsheet data and convert it into a usable format (e.g., JSON).
   - Scope Generation: Create logic to generate a scope of work based on selected items.
   - Database Interaction: Save user selections and estimates.
2. Frontend Development:
   - User Interface: Build a form to upload the spreadsheet and display items in a selectable format (e.g., checkboxes or dropdowns).
   - Dynamic Updates: Use JavaScript to update the scope of work and cost summary as items are selected.
   - Display Results: Show the generated scope of work and total estimate to the user.

My skills include:
- html/css, javascript, typescript
- react.js, next.js, vue.js
- tailwindcss and bootstrap
- python, php
- Laravel, Django
- PostgreSQL, MySQL and MongoDB
- heroku and aws
- git, github  and gitlab

I can create responsive and visual appealing front-end and I optimize the Search Engin order. I ensure website performance using recent trends of web development. I follow user experiences, so my worked sites has short loading time, and visually appealing interface, and usage convenience interface. 
I write maintainable, updatable, and reusable code, and create well-structured, and performance optimized back-end logic. I design the best effective databases, tables, and indexes. 
I have strong experiences in website secure and third parties integrations, and I implemented many third parties like stripe, google maps on many projects.

I have good understanding about all processes of website development, and I follow the most effective methodology for delivering the result. I am hard worker and passionate of web development. If you give this task, I will devote myself to complete this task successfully. I hope to work with you.
Thank you.
