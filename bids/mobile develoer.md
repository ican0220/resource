Helloüòä
I understand that you have many proposals to consider, and the decision is yours to make. If you choose to work with me, I am confident that I will meet and exceed your expectations, proving that your choice was the right one.

I am a senior Mobile developer with 5+ years of experience. I develop 2 large mobile projects based on React Native and Flutter every year. And I have solved many small problems related to React Native such as payment gateway, chat app, learning app. Through these tasks, I have gained enough experience with React Native and Flutter. So I want to solve all the problems and develop large projects.
I have uploaded the Mobile projects that I have developed. You can check it here.

My skills are:
- React Native
- Flutter
- Laravel and Symfony
- Github
- Android and IOS
- Jira

I try to create clean and concise sites that are visually appealing but functional for the users. I think the success of my business is whether my work achieves the intention of the client. I put a lot of effort to reach the target audience in the best way.

My clients call me a passionate and strong problem solver. You will see successful results throughout the engagement, you will know a reliable and long-term developer, and you will never have to look for a new developer for your business again.

I can respond in all time zones. I just want to maintain long term relationships with my clients and help them grow their business significantly.
I would like to discuss this further.
Thanks.
Julio ü§ù.
