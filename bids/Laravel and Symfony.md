Helloüòä
My hourly rate is $15, but I can deliver the perfect result.
I understand that you have many proposals to consider, and the decision is yours to make. If you choose to work with me, I am confident that I will meet and exceed your expectations, proving that your choice was the right one.

I develop 2 large web projects based on Laravel and Symfony every year. And I have solved many small problems related to PHP and Node.js such as payment gateway, chat app, learning app. Through these tasks, I have gained enough experience with PHP. So I want to solve all the problems and develop large projects.

My recent projects are:
https://oor3d-front.vercel.app/
https://admin.stuffyoucanuse.org/dashboard
https://union-center.mrcoders.org/
https://alireza.com/

My skills are:
- HTML,CSS
- JavaScript and PHP
- Laravel and Symfony
- Github
- Jira

I try to create clean and concise sites that are visually appealing but functional for the users. I think the success of my business is whether my work achieves the intention of the client. I put a lot of effort to reach the target audience in the best way.

My clients call me a passionate and strong problem solver. You will see successful results throughout the engagement, you will know a reliable and long-term developer, and you will never have to look for a new developer for your business again.

I can respond in all time zones. I just want to maintain long term relationships with my clients and help them grow their business significantly.
I am able to work from now on.
Thanks.
