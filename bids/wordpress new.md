Hello
Good day! I see you are looking a reliable senior WordPress developer to creat multivendor wordpress website.

I think this website need WooCommerce and multi verndor plugin, and payment gateway integration.

Here are my previous works. You can check my previous works from these live sites.

My skills include:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP
- WordPress and Element
- WooCommerce
- Git, GitHub and GitLab
- Jira

I think you had good job of explaining about your job, but I have some questions.
1. Which wordpress theme are you going to use?
2. Which plugin for multi vendor are you going to use? (Astra, WoodMart, ...)

I am ready to discuss more details about your project at anytime. 
Thank you for a interesting job.
Best.
Vladyslav.
