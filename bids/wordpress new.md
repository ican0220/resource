Hello
Good day! I see you are looking a reliable senior WordPress developer to creat multivendor wordpress website.

I think I should have enough experineces, good problem solving skills, good communication skills, and I should be detail-oriented dev.

Here are my previous works. You can check my previous works from these live sites.
https://avada.com/
https://arstechnica.com/

My skills include:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP
- WordPress and Element
- WooCommerce
- Git, GitHub and GitLab
- Jira

I think you had good job of explaining about your job, but I have some questions.
1. Which wordpress theme are you going to use?
2. Which plugin for multi vendor are you going to use? (Astra, WoodMart, ...)

I am ready to discuss more details about your project at anytime. 
Thank you for a interesting job.
Best.
Vladyslav.
