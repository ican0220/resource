It is crucial for enhancing performance and ensuring a smooth user experience.
Virtual scrolling is a technique that draws only the visible portion of a large dataset, rather than rendering all items at once. This can reduce the number of DOM elements in the view, leading to improved performance.
I can use Angular CDK.
Angular provides a component from the Angular Component Development Kit (CDK) called  ScrollingModule  that makes it easy to implement virtual scrolling. 

Angular uses a change detection mechanism to track changes in the application state and update the view accordingly. For large datasets, this can lead to performance bottlenecks.

I can use OnPush  Change Detection Strategy

I can follow the following approach to implement.
- Use a Pipe for Filtering: Create a custom pipe that filters the list based on the user's input. Pipes in Angular are pure by default, meaning they only re-evaluate when their input changes, which helps in optimizing performance
- Use the Pipe in the Template
Apply the filter pipe in your component template where you display the list of items.

Challenges and Solutions:
1. Performance with Large Datasets**: 
- Challenge: Filtering a large dataset can lead to performance issues if not handled correctly. 
- Solution: Utilize the  trackBy  function in  *ngFor  to help Angular track items efficiently and only re-render items that have changed.
2. Handling Edge Cases: 
- Challenge: Users may enter special characters or unexpected input that could affect filtering. 
- Solution: Implement input sanitization and validation to ensure that the search term is processed correctly.
