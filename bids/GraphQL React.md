Hello, I can work on your React project and API integration with $15/hour. I can start the work right now. I can deliver the result with high quality as quickly as possible.  I want to work with you for long time. I have extensive experiences and skills in React.js

My skills include:
-html, css, js, ts
-GraphQL
-react.js and next.js and vue.js
-bootstrap and tailwindcss
-git, github and gitlab

To troubleshoot and resolve issues with GraphQL subscriptions in a React application, particularly when they only function correctly after a hard page refresh, I can follow these steps:

1. Check Subscription Setup
Ensure that subscription is set up correctly. This includes:
- Correct WebSocket URL: Verify that you are connecting to the correct WebSocket URL for your GraphQL server.
- Proper Subscription Query: Ensure that the subscription query is correctly defined and matches what the server expects.
2. Verify State Management
Make sure that React state management is correctly handling subscription data. Common issues can arise if the state is not being updated properly when new data arrives. Here are some points to check:
- Using Apollo Client: If you're using Apollo Client, ensure that you're using the  `useSubscription`  hook correctly. It should look something like this:
- State Updates: Ensure that your component is correctly reacting to state updates from the subscription. If you are using local state (e.g.,  `useState` ), make sure to update it whenever new data arrives.
3. Check WebSocket Connection
If the subscription works after a hard refresh, the WebSocket connection might not be established correctly initially. Check the following:
- WebSocket Connection Handling: Ensure that the WebSocket connection is being established when the component mounts.use the  `useEffect`  hook to manage this:
- Reconnection Logic: Implement logic to handle reconnections if the WebSocket connection drops.
4. Debugging
- Console Logging: Add console logs to track the subscription lifecycle. Check when the subscription is established, when data is received, and any errors that occur.
- Network Tab: Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the WebSocket connection in the Network tab. Look for messages being sent and received to ensure they align with your expectations.
5. Check for State Conflicts
If using multiple state management solutions (like Redux alongside Apollo), ensure that there are no conflicts between them. Only one source of truth should manage the relevant data to avoid inconsistencies.
6. Review Server-Side Implementation
If everything looks correct on the client side, review the server-side implementation of your GraphQL subscriptions:


My considerations to complete React project:
- responsive and visual appealing front-end design.
- reusable components
- functional components and Hook functions like useMemo and useCallback
- state management using Redux

I specialize in developing responsive frontends using technologies like React, ensuring that applications provide a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes. Additionally, I have extensive experience in API integration, allowing me to connect the frontend with backend services effectively. This includes fetching data, handling user inputs, and ensuring smooth communication between the client and server. My approach emphasizes both performance and usability, ensuring that users have an engaging and efficient experience.

I can work on full time. I stay cutting-edge and follow the recent trends. I hope to work with you for long time. 
Thank you.
