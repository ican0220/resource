Hello
Good day! I see you are looking a reliable AI engineer to create an Airport Manager web application using JavaScript and the Leaflet.js library.

Leaflet is a JavaScript library used to build web mapping applications. It allows developers without a GIS background to display tiled web maps hosted on a public server.I think this library is very fit library to view an airport on a satellite map and edit taxi paths and and other data in a visual drag/drop experience.

Here are my previous works. You can check my previous works from these live sites.

https://avinor.no/flyplass/lakselv/til-og-fra-flyplassen/taxi-og-bil

My skills include:
- React.js or Vue.js
- Leaflet: For rendering interactive maps.
- D3.js or Three.js (optional)
- CSS Frameworks
- Node.js (Express or NestJS)
- PostGIS, MongoDB
- Airports Data API 
- Socket.IO

I think you had good job of explaining about your job, but I have some questions.
1. What data sources are available for flight schedules, gate information, and airport layout? Are these sources real-time?
2. Which frameworks can we use for this system?

I am ready to discuss more details throught call or chatting about your project at anytime. 
Thank you for a interesting job.
Best.
Vladyslav.
