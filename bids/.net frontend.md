Hello, I can not only make frontend change but also upgrade into .net 8 or .net 9 with my hourly rate $15. I am available on EST time zone 8 am to 6 pm. I can deliver the result with high quality within deadlines. If necessary, I can integrate current front-end into .net backend. I can create responsive and user-friendly, and visual appealing front-end. I have good communication skills and abilities working with a team

My skills include:
- html/css/js/c#
- .net framework, asp.net.
- bootstrap and jquery
- git and github

My approach to complete your example tasks:
1. Replace Telerik Grid with ASP GridView
ASP GridView is a good replacement since it integrates well with the .NET ecosystem and supports data binding, paging, sorting, and templating features.
Steps:
Identify and replace all instances of Telerik Grid in your app with ASP GridView controls.
Use AutoGenerateColumns for dynamic binding or define specific columns using <asp:BoundField>, <asp:TemplateField>, etc.
2. Dynamic Loader for Controls Based on Test Type
You can dynamically load controls into a popup based on the selected test type using a combination of server-side code and client-side JavaScript or AJAX.
Steps:
Create a dropdown for selecting the test type.
In the selection event (e.g., SelectedIndexChanged), generate the required controls dynamically, such as a radio button list or textbox, and add them to the popup.
Use UpdatePanel or JavaScript for a smooth user experience.
3. Create New Search Form Grids and Entry Forms
Use existing pages as a reference to create new search forms and grids.
Steps:
Create new ASP.NET web forms or partial views for the search and entry functionality.
Utilize GridView or Repeater controls for the search results grid.
Use form controls (like TextBox, DropDownList, etc.) in your entry forms for data input, and handle the submission in the code-behind.
4. Upgrading to .NET 8 or 9
Upgrading from .NET 4.7 to .NET 8 or 9 will involve migrating to ASP.NET Core since these versions are based on the .NET Core/Unified platform.
Steps:
Convert the project to an ASP.NET Core Web Application, which will require adjusting the project structure, dependencies (NuGet packages), and configuration files (web.config to appsettings.json).
Replace WebForms controls (if applicable) with Razor Pages or MVC-style views in .NET Core, as WebForms is not supported in .NET 8 or 9.
Update third-party components (e.g., Telerik) to ensure compatibility with the new .NET versions.
Test the application thoroughly to ensure the dynamic controls, grids, and search functionality continue working.

I can start the work right now. I can work on full time and I can react with you at any time. I hope to work with you.
Thank you.

Hello, I can work on your Blazor .net 8. I can deliver the result with high quality within deadlines. If necessary, I can integrate current front-end into .net backend. I can create responsive and user-friendly, and visual appealing front-end. I have good communication skills and abilities working with a team

My skills include:
- html/css/js/c#
- .net framework, asp.net.
- bootstrap and jquery
- git and github

I have recently developed similar project: I uploaded relevant code. I worked as front-end developer, I implemented responsive and user-friendly design using bootstrap, jquery and media, and I integrated front-end and api endpoints.

I can work on full time and I can deliver the result as quickly as possible. I will devote myself to complete this task once I work on this project. I hope to work with you.
Thank you.
