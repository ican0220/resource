Hello, I think I am the best dev for your project, and I am very excited to submit my proposal.

My skill set:
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript, PHP
- React, Next.js and Vue.js
- .NET, ASP.NET Core, C#, Sitecore DXP
- Git, Github and Gitlab

I am a software developer with extensive experience in .NET technologies, including ASP.NET Core and C#, and have successfully implemented solutions using the Sitecore DXP platform.

In my previous role, I developed an enterprise-level application using ASP.NET Core, which improved the efficiency of internal processes by 25%. Additionally, I utilized the Sitecore DXP platform to create a seamless digital experience for users, leveraging its powerful content management capabilities.

I uploaded my recent .NET project.
I can work on full time, and I can work on your time zone. I can deliver the result with high quality within deadlines. I hope to work with you.
Thank you.
