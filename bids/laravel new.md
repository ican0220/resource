Hello
Good day! I see you are looking a reliable Laravel developer to join your team.

I think you expect effective and clean code, responsive and pixel perfect implementation of Figma designs, updating and maintaining of your existing websites from me.

Here are my previous works. You can check my previous works from these live sites.

My skills include:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP
- Laravel
- React and Vue.js
- Figma
- Git, GitHub and GitLab
- Jira
- AWS and Heroku

I think you had good job of explaining about your job, but I have some questions.
What do you think about using Next.js or Vue.js as front-end? In fact, Blade is not good at front end development. This is only my opinion.

I am ready to discuss more details about your project at anytime. 
Thank you for a interesting job.
Best.
Vladyslav.
