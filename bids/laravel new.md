Hello
Good day! I see you are looking a Tailwind AlpineJS Laravel Livewire developer to assist your team for a ongoing project.

I think your team is modern and cutting edge because you are using AlpineJS, a powerful JavaScript framework, Tailwincss as a CSS framework, and Laravel and Livewire as the latest Laravel framework. I am very interested in joining your team and would like to commit to helping grow your team.

Here are my previous works. You can check my previous works from these live sites.

My skills include:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP
- AlpineJS and JQuery
- Laravel, Livewire
- React and Vue.js
- Figma
- Git, GitHub and GitLab
- Jira
- AWS and Heroku

I think you had good job of explaining about your job, but I have some questions.
What do you think about using Next.js or Vue.js as front-end? In fact, Blade is not good at front end development. This is only my opinion.

I am ready to discuss more details about your project at anytime. 
Thank you for a interesting job.
Best.
Vladyslav.
