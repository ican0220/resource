Hello
Good day! I see you are looking a reliable web developer to help taking your finalized Figma prototype and implement the design into Squarespace.

I understand that his project aims to implement a finalized Figma prototype into Squarespace 7.1 by setting up a copy of the existing site, integrating Storemapper, and optimizing performance through the removal of unnecessary CSS and JS libraries, requiring expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

My skills include:
-HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP
-flexbox and Grid CSS
-Squarespace and Wix
-Responsive 
-Figma

My previous works:

I think you had good job of explaining about your job, but I have some questions.
1. Should the implementation prioritize any specific mobile breakpoints or design considerations?
2. Who will be the primary point of contact for questions or clarifications during the project?

I am very interested in fact that this is long term position. I am ready to discuss more details about your project at anytime. 
Thank you for a interesting job.
Best.
Vladyslav.
