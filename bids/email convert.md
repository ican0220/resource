Hello, I can deliver the result within today. I can start the work immediately. I can convert your Figam file into HTML/CSS email exactly. I can deliver the result with high quality asap, but it depends on your email design.  With my experience in crafting visually appealing and functional email templates, I can ensure that the email will render perfectly across different email clients, including Outlook, Gmail, and Apple Mail.

My considers for email creation:
1. Keep It Simple: Email clients have varying levels of support for CSS and HTML features. Stick to basic layouts and avoid complex structures. 
2. Use Tables for Layout: Use nested tables for layout instead of CSS positioning or flexbox, as tables are more widely supported across email clients. 
3. Inline CSS: Use inline styles for all CSS properties. Many email clients strip out  <style>  tags, so inline styles ensure that your designs are rendered correctly. 

My approach to reach with your requirements:
1. Creating basic email template
2. convert design elements like header, branding, content sections.
3. make it responsive
- media queries usage.
- fluid width
4. testing:
- Testing Tools: Use email testing tools like Litmus or Email on Acid to see how your email renders across different clients and devices. 
 - Adjust as Necessary: Based on the results, make adjustments to your HTML and CSS to address any rendering issues. 
5. Optimize for Deliverability 
- Avoid Spam Triggers: Use a clean code structure, avoid excessive images, and steer clear of spammy words in your content. 
- Use Alt Text: Always add alt text to images to ensure accessibility and provide context if images do not load. 

I can work on full time and I can complete this conversion successfully. I hope to work with you.
Thank you.
Brenton.
