Hello, Good day! I see you are looking an experienced .NET Full Stack Developer to display the data into frontend based on ASP.net. I can start the work immediately and I can deliver the best result within 1 week. I have carefully read your pdf and docs file and I think you had good job post. I understand your project was deployed on Azure.

I have a question.
Which framework do you use for this project? I guess you use ASP.net framework. So can I develope front-end and integrate apis in blazor? Or can I use other frameworks like React or Next.js?

I have recently developed similar project: I uploaded relevant code regarding to the following site.

I think I should have enough experineces, good problem solving skills, good communication skills, and I should be detail-oriented dev. I can write well-documented code, and well-structured, maintainable and updatable code. I can join to your team and I can do daily reports. I can deliver the rapid results, and I am a hard worker. I can work on your time zones and I can work on full time.

I am ready to discuss more details throughout call or chatting about your project at anytime. 
Thank you for a interesting job.
Best.
Vladyslav.
