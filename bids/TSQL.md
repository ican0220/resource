Hello, I can create a HTML page in TSQL with my budget $50. Creating HTML in T-SQL (SQL Server) can be done using FOR XML PATH to format the output into HTML, but generating complex HTML directly from SQL is not typical. Instead, I might want to retrieve the data from your SQL database and format it in a programming language like C#, Python, or even JavaScript to generate the HTML page with proper alignment.

However, if you're set on generating the HTML directly in T-SQL, I will follow the following steps for creating a baseball schedule for a month with games:

1. Prepare Data:
Assuming you have a table called Games with fields like GameDate, Team1, Team2, and Location, I can query the games for a particular month.
example code:
SELECT GameDate, Team1, Team2, Location 
FROM Games
WHERE MONTH(GameDate) = @Month
AND YEAR(GameDate) = @Year
ORDER BY GameDate;
2. Generate HTML in T-SQL:
I can create a simple HTML table using FOR XML PATH to format the results as HTML.

sql
Copy code
DECLARE @HTML NVARCHAR(MAX);

SET @HTML = '<html><body><table border="1">';

SET @HTML = @HTML + '<tr><th>Date</th><th>Team 1</th><th>Team 2</th><th>Location</th></tr>';

SET @HTML = @HTML + (
    SELECT 
        '<tr>' + 
        '<td>' + CONVERT(VARCHAR, GameDate, 101) + '</td>' + 
        '<td>' + Team1 + '</td>' + 
        '<td>' + Team2 + '</td>' + 
        '<td>' + Location + '</td>' +
        '</tr>'
    FROM Games
    WHERE MONTH(GameDate) = @Month AND YEAR(GameDate) = @Year
    FOR XML PATH('')
);

SET @HTML = @HTML + '</table></body></html>';

SELECT @HTML AS ScheduleHTML;

3. Output the HTML:
The result will be a simple HTML table containing your baseball game schedule for the selected month. The FOR XML PATH('') clause is used to concatenate the HTML elements into a single string.

This is example code. I can start the work right now. I hope to work with you.
Thank you.
